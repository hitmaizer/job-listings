That being said, we also work hard.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;\"><span style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\">Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you‚Äôre in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;\"><span style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\">Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn‚Äôt every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer‚Äôs questions, so you‚Äôll need to be prepared for that.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;\"><span style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\">A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;\"><span style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\">We focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; margin-top: 3rem;\"><span style=\"text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\">We‚Äôre made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us.

Engaging with teams across the organization, you will use critical thinking skills to solve the problem, all while keeping the customer informed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You are excited about working remotely.</strong> You enjoy communicating often with colleagues but rarely face-to-face. Not going out in the sun, rain, sleet, and snow is appealing! You are experienced using virtual communication, collaboration scheduling, and design tools to stay connected. <strong>Anyone in the US can apply!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You pay attention to details. </strong>Customers often write emails that are a bit confusing. You pay attention to the details and context clues to determine what they need.

You will be spending your entire day behind a computer so you need to love it!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You love to shop on Amazon </strong>(BIG bonus if you have experience selling on Amazon).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You love connecting with Customers personally. </strong>1:1 demonstrations, assisting with exciting webinars, and being a passionate presence at out-of-town conferences may be a part of your duties. It is crucial that this not only falls in your comfort wheelhouse but that you are excited about it!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You have flexible availability. </strong>We are hiring for two full-time positions: Monday - Friday 12pm - 8pm ET, and Thursday - Monday 8AM-4PM ET (8 hour days, 5 days a week). Your schedule will generally be set, but there are times it may need to be temporarily adjusted for coverage purposes, so flexibility is a huge plus! <strong>Any US timezone is acceptable</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You have the ability to occasionally travel.</strong> Day-to-day work and training is all virtual, but if conditions allow you may be selected to represent our company at an out-of-town conference - all company paid, of course! Being virtual is awesome, but it's also fun to get out in the world when we're able to again.<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You love working with a team. </strong>Even though we're fully remote, you'll feel like a big part of the team. Each day may include working with the Champion team to resolve tickets and ensure our internal documentation is up to date. Sometimes, you'll work with other members of the company for research and to assist with improving our product.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Is your hand waving in the air, and are you saying ‚ÄúPick Me, Pick Me!‚Äù?

Clients include Adidas, The North Face, Hillrom, Yamaha, Philips and more. Our CG artists, interactive designers, and developers focus on creating virtual versions of our clients' products, so lifelike it feels like you could reach out and touch them. Our culture brings together creative, tech and business individuals. It‚Äôs a heady cocktail that keeps us inspired, empowered and passionate.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating concepts and coming up with ways to explain them to clients and team members alike: via pitch decks, style proposals, storyboards, sketches, mood boards, mock-ups, you name it.</li>\n<li>Interpreting client briefs, identifying their needs and translating them into a clear direction for the team.</li>\n<li>Coming up with ways to bring everyone around to the next level of video projects, while meeting the project‚Äôs objectives and client expectations.</li>\n<li>Coordinating in-house and external teams, providing constructive feedback and approvals.</li>\n<li>Overseeing all aspects of video production from concept to delivery. Ensuring our videos meet the creative and visual quality we stand for, end-to-end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Would be nice if you‚Ä¶</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have 3+ years of experience in a similar position.</li>\n<li>Love products. We do headphones, motorcycles and MRI systems alike, so candidates should be prepared to grok how stuff works from day one. If you don‚Äôt know what grok is, grok the word grok.</li>\n<li>Love humans. Art-directors inside INDG are in direct contact with English-speaking customers, defending and explaining their concepts and with English-speaking talented artists all over the world, leading the execution of these concepts.</li>\n<li>Love stories and moving images. Storytelling skills are as crucial as an exceptional eye -and an exceptional eye for detail. You have a portfolio or reel that reflects this.</li>\n<li>We are not going to ask you to love deadlines, but you should feel comfortable to lead the team through milestones even when time is tight and stress levels are high.</li>\n<li>Have a hands-on attitude. Editing, animation or motion graphics knowledge is a big plus. We expect all candidates to be digitally fluent, but skills in After Effects, Premiere or other postproduction tools are highly regarded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What we offer</strong></p>\n<p>This is a remote friendly role. Most of us work from Amsterdam or Bucharest, and if you‚Äôre close to any of the two, we‚Äôre more than happy to welcome you in our offices.

A set of automated tools and technologies to buy advertising in real-time and deliver strong performance for advertisers.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve proved that our approach works with over <strong>200 brands</strong> running more than <strong>1500 campaigns</strong> as we've consistently beaten every advertising platform on the market in performance. That's why we've quickly grown to an <strong>8 figures in revenue</strong>.</p>\n<p>We are now building and deploying a self-served platform that allows advertisers to launch campaigns in less than 5 minutes on any digital inventory (Web, Apps, connected TV, ...) to deliver results for their brand. This <strong>simple and efficient</strong> platform will soon be available for advertisers across <strong>Europe and North America</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Who we are</div>\n<p>KMTX was founded in 2017 by two serial tech entrepreneurs: Franck Tetzlaff (co-founder of Doctolib) and Arthur Querou (co-founder of MotionLead acquired by Adikteev).</p>\n<p><strong>We‚Äôve raised $3m</strong> to date and plan to raise another significant round in the coming months.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre obsessed with <strong>meaningful, powerful tech which simplifies</strong> the work of our users.</p>\n<p>We're not afraid to <strong>challenge the status quo!</strong></p>\n<p>We believe that small increments don't drive change. Anything we do must be<strong> better</strong> than what existed before.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Working at KMTX</div>\n<p>We hire people whom we admire. Forward thinkers, who challenge the status quo, get out of their comfort zone, are not afraid to fail, have a high-level of self-awareness and expectation while parking their ego at the door.</p>\n<p>We believe that work shouldn't be ‚Äújust a job‚Äù, but <strong>an opportunity to grow</strong>. To perform at their best, our people should be happy and challenged. We want our people to evolve, learn, and grow in a pleasurable work environment.</p>\n<p>We care a lot about <strong>autonomy and trust, and </strong>we lead by example by being very flexible on work hours and projects you choose to spend your time on.

A¬∑Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A¬∑Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A¬∑Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li><strong>High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</strong> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters.

We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A¬∑Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>\n<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr.
